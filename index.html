         <h1>Water Usage and Supply Trends in Malaysia (2020 - 2022)</h1>
         <p>Water is the lifeblood of Malaysia, sustaining both communities and industries. 
            Between 2020 and 2022, total water production rose steadily by 900 million liters per day, 
            while consumption remained largely stable. 
            The chart below offers a national-level view, 
            illustrating how supply has expanded over time and how it compares with the relatively steady demand.</p>

        <!-- Description-->
        <p>From a national perspective, Malaysia’s water supply has grown 
            while overall consumption has remained steady. 
            But the story becomes more intricate when we look closer at each state.</p>
        
        <!--Choropleth Map-->
        <p>Zooming in at the state level, per capita water usage highlights the differences 
            in domestic and industrial demand across regions. 
            Some states consume more water per person, reflecting variations in population density, 
            lifestyle, and economic activity.
        </p>

         <!--Bar Chart-->
        <p>When viewed alongside total water production by state, it becomes clear how supply meets regional demand. 
            Comparing these charts reveals which states have surplus capacity 
            and which may face challenges in aligning production with consumption.</p>

        <div id="water_production_chart"></div>

        <p>Earlier, we saw that Malaysia’s national water production has increased steadily, 
            while consumption has remained relatively stable. 
            But every drop of treated water comes from raw water—drawn from rivers, dams, groundwater, and other sources. 
            Understanding raw water availability is essential to see how production is sustained over time.</p>

        <h2>Raw Water Resources</h2>

        <div id="water_resources_chart"></div>

        <p>The line chart showing total raw water extraction from 2020 to 2022 highlights the overall trend in national water availability. 
            It reflects both natural conditions and water management practices, providing context for the production capacities we observed earlier.</p>

        <h2>Breakdown by Source</h2>

        <p>Not all raw water is the same. 
            The donut charts illustrate how rivers, dams and other sources contribute to the national supply, 
            with each slice representing a year from 2020 to 2022. 
            This breakdown reveals which sources are most relied upon and how the composition of raw water has shifted over time, 
            forming the foundation for Malaysia’s water production.</p>
